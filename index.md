### Customer Segmentation 

This project involved analyzing customer data to derive actionable insights through segmentation using KMeans clustering. Key features such as Monetary Value, Frequency, and Recency were engineered and scaled for clustering. Outliers were identified and handled separately to enhance the analysis. The final output categorized customers into meaningful segments, providing a foundation for targeted marketing strategies. Visualizations and statistical summaries were utilized to illustrate the distribution and characteristics of each segment, enabling better decision-making for customer relationship management.

Here, the plot visualizes customer cluster distribution and average feature values, highlighting the number of customers per cluster alongside their average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value per 100 pounds.

### Disease Prediction Model Using Multiple Classifiers

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict potential diseases based on symptoms provided by users. Utilizing a dataset of symptoms and corresponding disease outcomes, the model employs multiple classifiers, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to generate accurate predictions.

### Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project analyzes customer data to predict churn behavior using linear regression. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Insights derived from the analysis aim to enhance strategies for reducing churn.

In this visualization, I displayed the distribution of contract types among churned customers, differentiating them by payment method. This plot helps to identify trends in customer churn related to contract agreements.

### Customer Sentiment Trends with VADER Analysis

This project focused on sentiment analysis using VADER to categorize customer reviews based on their polarity (positive, neutral, negative). I handled data preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and visualizing sentiment trends across various score levels. By addressing the challenge of visual clarity, I ensured the insights were intuitive and actionable for further analysis.

This plot compares positive, neutral, and negative sentiment distributions across review scores. I tackled the challenge of visual clarity by organizing the data into subplots and using a clean layout, ensuring each sentiment is easy to interpret.
