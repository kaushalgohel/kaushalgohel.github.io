### Customer Segmentation 

This project involved analyzing customer data to derive actionable insights through segmentation using KMeans clustering. Key features such as Monetary Value, Frequency, and Recency were engineered and scaled for clustering. Outliers were identified and handled separately to enhance the analysis. The final output categorized customers into meaningful segments, providing a foundation for targeted marketing strategies. Visualizations and statistical summaries were utilized to illustrate the distribution and characteristics of each segment, enabling better decision-making for customer relationship management.

### Disease Prediction Model Using Multiple Classifiers

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict potential diseases based on symptoms provided by users. Utilizing a dataset of symptoms and corresponding disease outcomes, the model employs multiple classifiers, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to generate accurate predictions.
